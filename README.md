# Game-Review-Rating-Prediction-Using-Text-Mining-and-Machine-Learning

This project was developed to predict user rating levels based on textual Clash Royale game reviews by using text mining and machine learning approaches. I constructed a dataset consisting of 1,000 English-language game reviews collected from the Google Play Store, covering a wide range of rating categories to ensure balanced representation. The project explores how different text representations resulting the classification performance. The workflow includes exploratory text analysis to uncover dominant keywords for each rating level and identify informal or non-standard language patterns commonly found in user-generated reviews. And then i performed the preprocessing steps including cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, etc in order to generate high-quality features.

In this project, there are two feature extraction approaches that were implemented and compared, TF-IDF for capturing word importance, meanwhile Word2Vec to preserves semantic relationships between words. There are two classification models trained and tuned, which are Random Forest and XGBoost, with performance evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to determine the most effective modeling approach. And then handled the imbalanced data and retrained all models again.
